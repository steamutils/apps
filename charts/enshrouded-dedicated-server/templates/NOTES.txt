Your enshrouded server is now reachable at:
Game Port:  {{ .Values.serverGamePort }}
Query Port: {{ .Values.serverQueryPort }}

You can get your server IPs by running the following command:

	kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath="{.items[*].status.addresses[].address}"

If this is your first time creating this deployment, your enshrouded-dedicated-server-0 pod will be taking time to download the enshrouded dedicated server binaries before the game server is made available.

If you want to check on the status of your dedicated server run the following command:

	kubectl logs -f -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} pod/enshrouded-dedicated-server-0 

Your Enshrouded Dedicated Server binaries will be located in PVC: steamapp
Your Proton Prefix will be located in PVC: proton
Your Server Logs will be located in PVC: logs
Your Savegame will be stored and mounted from PVC: {{ if .Values.importedSave.enabled }}{{ .Values.importedSave.pvcName }}{{ else }}savegame{{ end }}
